        "Data science transforms raw data into actionable insights through a structured process that begins with ethical and effective data collection, followed by careful cleaning and processing. Techniques such as web scraping using Python libraries enable the extraction of valuable information, while tools like Google Analytics and direct data collection methods provide additional rich and contextual data sources. However, collected data often contains inconsistencies and requires preparation before analysis. Tools such as OpenRefine and Python’s Pandas library play a critical role in organizing, standardizing, and correcting data to ensure quality and reliability. By combining these tools and methods, data scientists can ensure data integrity, avoid misleading conclusions, and focus on extracting meaningful insights that support informed decision-making and business success."

I used regex to divide the entire extracted HTML object into different columns, such as product description, price, size... I confess it took me a while to figure out how to do this. It's a very useful function applicable to almost any e-commerce website.\n",

After that, the data was saved again in a new dataset with clean and filtered data.\n",
