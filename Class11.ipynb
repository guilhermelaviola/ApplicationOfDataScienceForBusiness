        "# **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
        "Sentiment analysis is a business tool that uses artificial intelligence to evaluate customers’ emotions and opinions from textual data such as social media comments, reviews, and customer service messages. By classifying content as positive, negative, or neutral—often with the help of sentiment dictionaries and tools like TextBlob and VADER—companies can gain valuable insights into consumer behavior. It is widely applied in marketing, sales, customer service, and reputation management to monitor campaigns, identify dissatisfied customers, and improve products and services. Although it offers benefits such as automation, real-time insights, and personalized customer experiences, its accuracy depends on data quality, appropriate tools, and careful interpretation alongside other strategic metrics."
